CoOPS protocol specification 1.0draft 1
====================================

OVERVIEW
--------

CoOPS is a protocol which allows users to simultaneously edit a file in a server. The protocol focuses on the core of the simultaneous editing, leaving out other functions - such as user management, file creation, file deletion, etc. These functions are extensions to the basic protocol. The protocol defines the client-server communication using HTTP protocol.

The protocol assumes that each file is located in a address that can be used for file identification (URL). All protocol operations are relative to this address. This allows the protocol to be used in variety of different contexts, such as editing of html document, a paragraph of a wiki page or a svg image. Because the editing environment (blog, wiki, etc. server program) usually contains user registration and authentication functions these are left out of the scope of protocol. Communication between server and client is done via HTTP protocol using JSON formatted data.

Protocol also defines way to transfer meta-information besides normal file content. 

It makes sense to use different diff / patch algorithms for different file types. For this reason, client and the server negotiate used diff / patch algorithmic before starting.

This document is currently just a draft of the specification and it's constantly evolving. Specification is done in hand in hand with the reference implementation so most recent state can be found from https://github.com/foyt/coops-server-node/

TODO Overview

### Status Codes

<table width="100%">
  <tr><td>200 - OK</td><td>Used when request has succeeded.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>404 - Not Found</td><td>When requested file could not be found</td></tr>
  <tr><td>409 - Conflict</td><td>When request has failed because of a conflict</td></tr>
  <tr><td>500 - Internal Server Error</td><td>When request has failed unexpectedly</td></tr>
  <tr><td>501 - Not Implemented</td><td>When client has requested for a unsupported feature</td></tr>
</table>

Implementations may use other status codes besides ones used in protocol.

### (GET) / (load request)

Returns file and file meta-information. If revision number parameter is specified method returns file of that specified revision otherwise last revision is returned

        "properties": {
            "backgroundColor": "green"
        }
	  }
	}

### (GET) /join (join request)

Client calls method when joining file collaboration and resolves used algorithm and extensions.

  <tr><td>Parameters</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;algorithm</td><td>(Query) algorithm(s) supported by client. Parameter can be repeated to indicate support for multiple algorithms. In this case algorithms should be ordered descendingly from most favourable to least favourable algorithm</td></tr>

EXTENSIONS
----------
TODO Overview

### WebSocket

WebSocket is an extension for the basic protocol and every implementation does not necessary need to implement it. WebSockets provide faster and lighter way for server and client to communicate.

**Protocol extensions**

When extension is enabled it should be listed on [join request](#get-join-join-request) extensions list and "webSocketUrl" should be added under "response" -field of same request.

*Format of the webSocketUrl is following:*

    protocol ":" "//" host ":" port path token

**protocol** can be either ws or wss depending on whether TLS socket should be used.<br/>
**host** is a host where server is located<br/>
**path** path to a file<br/>
**token** optional token which can be used to authenticate incoming socket connection <br/>

*Example url*

    "ws://www.example.com:80/path/to/file/token"    
    
**Messages**

Instead of standard protocol API calls communication between server and client is done via WebSocket messages. 

**Message format**

Messages always include "type" property that indicates a type of a message. Other properties depend on the message type.

    {
      "type": "MESSAGE TYPE",
      "PROPERTY NAME": "PROPERTY VALUE"
    }

**Messages to server**

***patch***

Client sends a patch to server. Request has to contain revisionNumber field so server can check for version conflicts. Before sending next patch client should wait for patchAccepted or patchRejected message.

    {
      "type": "patch",
      "patch": "patch content in used diff format",
      "revisionNumber": number of revision patch is meant for
    }
    
**Messages to client**

***patch***

Server sends a patch to a client.

    {
      "type": "patch",
      "patch": "patch content in used diff format",
      "revisionNumber": number of revision patch is meant for,
      "checksum": content checksum for integrity checks (optional)
    }

***patchAccepted***

Server send a message that is has accepted patch client sent.

    {
      "type": "patchAccepted",
      "revisionNumber": number of revision patch is meant for
    }
    
***patchRejected***

Server send a message that is has rejected patch client sent.

    {
      "type": "patchAccepted",
      "revisionNumber": number of revision patch is meant for,
      "reason": "reason for rejection"
    }
